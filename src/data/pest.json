        "description": "The adult allium leaf miner is a small dark-coloured fly approximately 3mm in length. The female flies make small puncture marks into the tips of leaves and lay eggs into the plant tissue. Eggs hatch into maggots that burrow down into the plant creating tunnels as they feed and grow. The maggots turn into small brown pupae at the base of the plants, either remaining in the mine or breaking out between the stem and the leaves.",
        "damage": "Puncture marks where the female flies have been laying eggs appear as a series of white dots on the tips of leaves. The resulting maggots produce mines that run down through the plant, often resulting in rotting that can eventually destroy the whole plant. Plants can be effectively protected by covering them with an insect-proof mesh, at times when the adult flies are active and laying eggs. ",
        "tips": "Infected crops should be removed during the winter months when the pupae are dormant. Those that may be within the soil can be exposed to insectivorous birds by regularly digging the soil. "

        "description": "Cabbage aphids are sap-sucking insects that appear bluish-grey due to a pale waxy coating. They form dense clusters on the undersides of leaves, particularly on brassicas, causing yellowing and curling of foliage. Infestations increase in late summer and persist through autumn.",
        "damage": "Cabbage aphids camouflage well and may go unnoticed until their populations grow. They feed by sucking sap, leading to stunted plant growth and discolored leaves. Black honeydew deposits on plants indicate their feeding activity. Late-maturing brassicas like Brussels sprouts are especially susceptible to damage.",

        "description": "Red lily beetles are bright red, about 8 mm long, with black legs and antennae. The larvae are orange-red with black heads and are often covered in their own excrement, which helps to hide them from predators.",
        "damage": "Both adults and larvae feed on leaves, stems, flowers, and buds, causing significant defoliation. Heavy infestations can weaken bulbs, reducing their ability to flower in subsequent years.",
        "tips": "Inspect plants regularly and handpick adults, larvae, and eggs. Remove debris where they can hide, and use approved insecticides only if necessary. Introducing natural predators like parasitoid wasps can help manage populations."

        "description": "Red spider mites are tiny, sap-feeding mites, typically red or brown, that thrive in warm, dry conditions. They are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they suck sap, causing damage.",
        "damage": "Infested plants show speckled yellow or bronze leaves, which can drop prematurely. In severe cases, red spider mite infestations lead to defoliation and reduced plant vigor. Fine webbing may be visible, especially during heavy infestations.",
        "tips": "Increase humidity around plants to deter mites. Regularly spray plants with water to dislodge mites. Use insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils, and introduce natural predators like *Phytoseiulus persimilis*, a predatory mite, for biological control."

        "damage": "Feeding by adults and larvae causes noticeable chewing damage to leaves and flowers, sometimes leading to defoliation. However, the damage is generally not severe enough to harm healthy plants.",
        "tips": "Handpick beetles and larvae when noticed. Prune affected plants to reduce infestations. For large infestations, shake plants over a sheet to collect beetles. Encourage natural predators like birds to help manage the beetle population."

        "description": "Scale insects are small, sap-feeding insects covered with waxy, shell-like coverings. They range from less than 1mm to over 1cm in diameter and can be found on the stems and undersides of leaves.",
        "damage": "Feeding on plant sap causes yellowing, stunted growth, and the secretion of honeydew, which leads to sooty mold. In large numbers, they can weaken plants and affect overall plant health.",
        "tips": "Light infestations can be tolerated, but for heavier infestations, manually scrape off insects. Apply horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to control scale insects. Encourage natural predators like ladybirds and parasitoid wasps to help manage populations."

        "damage": "Slugs cause significant damage to leaves and stems by chewing ragged holes or completely consuming parts of the plant. They often leave slime trails behind, which can indicate their presence.",
        "tips": "To manage slug populations, use beer traps, copper tape, or organic slug pellets. Encourage natural predators such as birds, hedgehogs, and ground beetles to help control them. Regularly removing plant debris and using barriers can reduce slug hiding spots and feeding opportunities."

        "tips": "Handpick snails during the evening or early morning. Use barriers such as crushed eggshells or copper tape to deter them. Encouraging natural predators like birds, hedgehogs, and frogs can also help manage snail populations."

        "damage": "The mines caused by the larvae reduce photosynthesis, causing wilting and, in severe cases, can lead to plant death. The damage significantly reduces the yield and quality of tomatoes and potatoes.",
        "tips": "Remove and destroy infested leaves promptly to limit the spread. Use fine mesh covers to prevent adult moths from laying eggs. Monitor crops with pheromone traps to detect moth activity early."

        "tips": "Use nematodes (Steinernema kraussei or Heterorhabditis) to control larvae in late summer or early autumn. Handpick adult beetles during the evening, or use sticky traps. Encourage natural predators like birds, frogs, and hedgehogs to help control the population."

        "tips": "To manage wireworms, use traps like cut potatoes to attract and catch larvae. Practice crop rotation to reduce infestations over time. Encourage natural predators such as birds and ground beetles, and consider using nematodes (*Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*) for biological control."
